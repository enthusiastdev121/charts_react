#### React Stockcharts - Built with [React JS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [d3](http://d3js.org/)

React Stockcharts provides a flexible api to create charts that represent time series data. You can

- add custom chart components
- add custom indicators
- access the `svg` elements and styling with CSS (when using svg)
- get fast performance to pan and zoom actions, when using the hybrid mode

There are many charting libraries available, but I feel there are very few that provide the features and flexibility to create stock charts that compete with the likes of the ones provided by commercial trading systems. Here is my humble attempt.
