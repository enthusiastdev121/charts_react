Creating a dark background is simply modifying some of the props to use the colors you want. The important thing to note here is that `canvas` & `svg` are transparent, so the background is simply controlled by css. For the example below the background is configured as

```css
.dark {
    background: #303030;
}
```

There are multiple other properties which have to be customized to make the chart appear as below. see them all in the [source](https://gist.github.com/rrag/23dd469fe32d7fc1977c), [block](http://bl.ocks.org/rrag/23dd469fe32d7fc1977c), [plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/gist:23dd469fe32d7fc1977c?p=preview) of this example
