## <span style="color:steelblue">Click on the chart to focus it, and then zoom by mouse scroll, pan by dragging the chart</span>

[source](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts/blob/master/docs/lib/charts/CandleStickChartWithZoomPan.jsx), [block](http://bl.ocks.org/rrag/a8465abe0061df1b7976), [plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/gist:a8465abe0061df1b7976?p=preview)

The only change is enabling `zoom` and `pan`
```jsx
<EventCapture mouseMove zoom pan />
```
enabling `zoom` and `pan` to `true`

By default the chart is not focussed. meaning. you have to click on the chart to get focus, and only then will the scroll events trigger a zoom.
