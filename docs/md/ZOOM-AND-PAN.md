The only change is enabling `zoom` and `pan`
```html
<EventCapture mouseMove={true} zoom={true} pan={true} mainChart={1} defaultFocus={false} />
```
other than enabling `zoom` and `pan`, `defaultFocus` of `true` means mouse scroll over the chart, triggers zoom action if zoom is enabled. If `defaultFocus` is `false`, you have to click on the chart to get focus and then all scroll events are zoom events if `zoom` is enabled
