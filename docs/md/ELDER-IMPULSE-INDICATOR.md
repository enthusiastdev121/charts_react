green bars indicate oportunities for long, and red bars for short. Blue bars are neither

This indicator is a little tricky because the main chart has to be drawn **after** the MACD and the EMA are calculated. The indicator is quite flexible in that, it extends the Elder Impulse system of comparing an `EMA` and `MACD` to comparing 2 or more of *any* indicators. Below example compares `EMA(12)` with the `MACD(26, 12, 9)` bar
